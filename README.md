# expo-pomodoro
Mobile app built in Expo env (React native + TypeScript) for learning purpose
>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo[1] in the late 1980s.[2] The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

* UI system built using `native-base`
* Choose time intervals - 3 predefined: Focus, short break and long break
* Reset button to set timer back to its initial value
* Pause / start timer
